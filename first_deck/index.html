    <h3>Rational</h3>

<ul>
<li>Uncertainty of cholera transmission pathways still exists and is difficult to infer with contemporary data</li>
<li>High quality data from 1853 Copenhagen outbreak can potentially provide information on transmission pathways</li>
</ul>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Evaluate the degree to which water-borne transmission routes drove the Copenhagen cholera outbreak of 1853, relative to non-water-borne transmission routes</li>
</ul>
